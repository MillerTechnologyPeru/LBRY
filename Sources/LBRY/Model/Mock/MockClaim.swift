The saying goes that “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure,” and as we speak, researchers around the globe are experimenting with taking this phrase literally. Right now, it’s possible to turn waste from brewing beer into batteries and to generate electricity from wastewater. There’s a lot of projects showing that practically no kind of waste is off-limits…including what our own bodies produce. I mean … there’s no shortage of waste, right? But there’s also no shortage of innovation for reusing it either. So, we’re not onto flying cars quite yet, but how close are we to Mr. Fusion?

We talked about the struggle her and Drew faced during the lock-downs, challenges of the art business, finding balance as an artist and much more. This was such an amazing experience and I found myself writing notes on the awesome tips she has for art business.\nMaria has not only had a massive impact on the art world, but on me personally. I look forward to seeing where her journey takes her in the future!\n\n- Tisch\n...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLRHks4KQo","languages":["en"],"license":"Copyrighted (contact publisher)","release_time":"1691067604","source":{"hash":"43d735fdefa70909f7eee1d5025a31e927e7c5839b9727ca05756c86e38d8b607ce1cf2a4028ae073d970f1066afd86c","media_type":"video/mp4","name":"inside-the-art-business-maria.mp4","sd_hash":"ea2de35676e9f39d107f6a4e85df49c1442dc6553708d680db9504a830e83e1fc615699df9d9625bc28124678ac53457","size":"480026090"},"stream_type":"video","thumbnail":{"url":"https://thumbnails.lbry.com/5oLRHks4KQo"},"title":"Inside the ART BUSINESS!

The answer, probably something like the galaxy ESO 306-17. This supergiant elliptical galaxy is the result of a fossil group. It is one million light years in diameter, but reached this size by consuming its neighbouring galaxies. Now, the galaxy is completely isolated in space, with no neighbouring galaxies for tens of millions of light years.
